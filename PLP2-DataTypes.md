Naming Requirements for Variables

Javascript requires that all variables be initialized following this general format: var x = 4

Here, var is a constant requirement in Javascript to let the program know that you are instantiating a variable. X is the variable name and 4 is the value that I am assigning to x. 
Variables can also be initialized by using “let” instead of “var” (let x = 4). Variables initialized in this way cannot be redeclared, meaning the value can never be changed. 
Variable names can begin with an upper or lower case letter, a dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Javascript recognizes the dollar sign as a letter, and so it is valid to create variable names containing them.

Language Type

Javascript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of the variable can change at compile time. So, a variable can be initialized as an integer but can be redeclared as a string (when using var). 

Javascript is also a weakly typed language, meaning that type errors are not detected by the compiler before the program runs. The program will run until it encounters an error.


Javascript Usability

Javascript is actually very user-friendly. Having only one data type for all numbers seems to make coding easier at this level, but it is hard to judge the obstacles that this could create in more sophisticated or elaborate programming. 
Being able to store different data types in lists is also very helpful. Additionally, the different methods of instantiating a variable (var, let, const) are very useful for having more control over whether or not a variable is mutable.
