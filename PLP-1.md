#Javascript

Javascript is an easy-to-use coding language primarily used for web development. But, it has many other uses as well. Javascript is used to alter html, so it is not used to write code to create the website, but rather to make web pages interactive. For example, using Javascript, one can add animation to a webpage or create tabs on web pages. Javascript can also be used to create simple internet games and is starting to be used to create mobile applications.

#History

Javascript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was originally created for Netscape 2 but then became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. 

#Use

Javascript already runs in all browsers, so it does not need to be downloaded! Javascript can be used in the web console of any browser, but I am going to be using Visual Studio Code for the programming environment since I am already somewhat familiar with it. I may also use the Chrome web console in the early stages of my learning for the ease of following along with tutorials. To run a command or program in the web console, all you have to do is press enter or return. In Visual Studio Code, you must access the file through the terminal and then run it using node.js. Comments can be written using two backslashes (//) in front of the text that you would like to comment out.


#Sources

I plan to get most of my information from the W3Schools website and the GeeksforGeeks website, as these are fairly credible resources that I have utilized before. I also plan on using Mozilla’s free guide to Javascript for more in-depth information but I will use Chrome’s javascript tutorials as well for specific information on running javascript in the Chrome web console (since I hate Firefox).
